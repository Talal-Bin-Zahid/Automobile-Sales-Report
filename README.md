## 📊 Project Overview

The **Automobile Sales Analysis Dashboard** is an interactive **Power BI** solution designed for **used car dealership managers** to monitor performance, evaluate market pricing, and optimize inventory decisions.

This dashboard transforms raw automobile sales data into clear, actionable insights — helping stakeholders understand:

* Which car makes and body types generate the most revenue
* How mileage and vehicle condition influence selling prices
* How actual sale prices compare against industry benchmarks (MMR)

The ultimate goal is to support **data-driven pricing strategies, inventory planning, and sales forecasting**.

## 📈 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

| KPI                       | Value             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| **Total Sales Revenue**   | **$8 Billion**    | The overall revenue generated from all used car sales in the dataset.                                                                                                                                         |
| **Total Cars Sold**       | **550,000 Units** | Total number of vehicles sold across all categories.                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Average Selling Price** | **$13,610**       | Mean price at which cars are sold, reflecting market valuation.                                                                                                                                               |
| **Average Odometer**      | **68,320 Miles**  | Average mileage of sold vehicles, indicating usage level.                                                                                                                                                     |
| **MMR Variance**          | **$88 Million**   | Difference between **Manheim Market Report (MMR) values** and the **actual selling price**. A positive variance suggests cars are selling above market benchmark; a negative variance indicates underpricing. |

> **MMR (Manheim Market Report)** represents the industry-standard valuation of used vehicles.
> **MMR Variance = Actual Selling Price – MMR Value**
